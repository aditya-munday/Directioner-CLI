/**
 * The directioner.com/chat thinker child, spawned by base-chat.
 *
 * Uses GPT-6 Luna with extra-high reasoning for Chat deliberation. It ran
 * GPT-5.6 Luna until 2026-09-24, when 5.6 was withdrawn from free mode; GPT-6
 * Luna is its successor and the cheaper of the two on its flex lane.
 *
 * The id stays `thinker-gemini`: chat/agent.ts registers it by import, the
 * hidden-agent list and DIRECTIONER_GEMINI_PRO_AGENT_IDS name it, and base-chat's
 * prompt spawns it by name. Renaming buys nothing and touches all of them.
