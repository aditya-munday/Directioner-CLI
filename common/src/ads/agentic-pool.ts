 * Agentic cards -- a paid generic proposal (lane A) or a non-billable setup
 * invitation (lane B) -- used to be served IN the `Desktop-Inline-Chat`
 * display slot, so every one of them replaced a display ad, and a paid offer
 * only became a proposal if it also won first-party display selection. The
 * pool serves them on a placement of their own, beside the display ad: the
 * display response is what it would have been had agentic not existed.
