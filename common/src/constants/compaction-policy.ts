 * context-pruner (base2, base-chat) receive it as

 * 15 minutes is about how long Luminal keeps a session's prefix cache. Past
 * that the next prompt re-reads everything at full price either way, so the
 * hour only buys a bigger cold prefill.
 *
 * 40k tokens rather than 140k because the hour-era floor assumed a marginal
 * trade, and here it is not. Measured with the runtime's own pass: the
 * per-message transforms alone strip ~87% of a tool-heavy coding history at
 * every size, so the budget walk the 140k figure waits for never matters.
 * What they cannot touch is the fixed prefix — ~13k tokens of tool schemas
 * plus prompt, knowledge files and git summary, typically 15-20k — so at 40k
 * the pass halves the cold prefill, while at 25k it removes a third at best
 * and drops exactly the files the model will re-read. On this lane a cold
 * input token costs ~40x a cached one, so halving a cold 60k prefill is a
 * material share of a turn's spend; the figures behind that are in
 * directioner-costs.knowledge.md (private).
