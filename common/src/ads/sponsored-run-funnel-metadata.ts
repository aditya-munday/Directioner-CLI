/**
 * What a sponsored run's OUTCOME row in `ad_agentic_funnel_event` carries
 * beside it (COD-665): `run_failed`, `run_committed` and `run_delivered`.
 *
 * Before this those rows had `metadata = null`, and the only record of WHY a
 * run failed was `failure_reason` / `diagnostic_reason` on the Convex
 * proposal row -- so the Postgres funnel could count failures and say nothing
 * about them, and every "why did 38 runs fail" question was a Convex export
 * joined by hand. This is the smallest closed shape that answers it from
 * Postgres alone.
 *
 * TELEMETRY, NEVER MONEY. Nothing reads this to bill, refund or settle: the
 * `accepted` row is the one billable stage and it has its own producer. A
 * test asserts this module imports nothing from billing.
 *
 * CLOSED AND BOUNDED ON PURPOSE. Every key but `diagnostic_reason` is an enum
 * or a boolean, and `diagnostic_reason` is SCRUBBED (`scrubSponsoredDiagnostic`)
 * and capped at `SPONSORED_FUNNEL_DIAGNOSTIC_MAX` characters. The full,
 * unscrubbed text stays on the Convex row, which is joined by `proposal_id`
 * when an operator needs it; the funnel is for counting, and a counting table
 * is not a place for a user's paths, prompts or repository text.
 *
 * ONE BUILDER FOR EVERY PRODUCER. The funnel row is insert-once per
 * `(campaign, <type>:<proposalId>)`, so whichever producer wins the race is
 * the row analytics reads. Both producers of these three events -- the
 * Convex outbox and the off-Cloud state route -- take the metadata from
 * `buildSponsoredRunFunnelMetadata`, computed ONCE inside the Convex
 * transition and handed to the route, so the winner is the same row either way.
