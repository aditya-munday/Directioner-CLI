/**
 * What a sponsored proposal in this terminal is ABOUT (COD-339, #3989).
 *
 * The folder's opaque id (`.directioner/project-id`) when it has one, because an
 * in-place offer is keyed to the checkout it will edit; otherwise `owner/name`
 * from the `origin` remote through the shared normalizer. A folder with
 * neither gets no card at all — without a stable key there is nothing to hang
 * an offer, a decline or a frequency cap on.
 *
 * RESOLVED ONCE PER PROCESS. The CLI's project root is fixed at launch, so the
 * answer cannot change under a running process the way it can under Desktop's
 * project switcher — which is why this is a memoized promise rather than
 * Desktop's TTL cache. A `git remote add` mid-session is real, and it costs the
 * user a restart to see an offer; spawning git on every poll of an optional ad
 * rail, forever, to catch it is the worse trade.
 *
 * The MEMO IS THE PROMISE, not the value: the poll and an accept can both ask
 * before the first `git` has answered, and caching the value would run the
 * command twice.
