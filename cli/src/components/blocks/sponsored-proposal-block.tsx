/**
 * The sponsored proposal, in the terminal's SPONSOR DOCK (#3989's flow, ported).
 *
 * Every string here comes from the shared view model, so this is the SAME state
 * machine the web panel and the desktop card run -- a card that reads
 * differently here is a bug rather than a port.
 *
 * ## Where it lives, and what the "button" is
 *
 * In the dock above the composer, in place of the display ad: one slot, one ad,
 * exactly as Desktop's card replaces its banner. It used to be a block in the
 * transcript, reachable only by typing `/ads:accept-proposal`, and it scrolled
 * away with the conversation. Now it stays put, and it has real controls:
 *
 *  - `[ Set it up ]` and `Not now` are mouse-clickable `Button`s (the display
 *    ad's CTA already is one);
 *  - Ctrl+O opens the details, where the arrows and Enter reach the same two
 *    answers plus the standing controls;
 *  - the `/ads:*` commands still work, for a terminal with no mouse.
 *
 * `Set it up` OPENS THE CONSENT and never accepts. The consent is the decision
 * (COD-336 item 4, adapted in `utils/sponsored-run.ts`); a click is a gesture.
 *
 * ## No bare keys while it is closed
 *
 * `useKeyboard` is a GLOBAL listener, not a focus-scoped one, so a bare `m`,
 * `esc` or `enter` bound here would reach the composer's handler as well: a
 * letter typed into a prompt would open an ad's menu, and an Esc aimed at
 * something else would be read as a decline. So while nothing is open this
 * component binds nothing; Ctrl+O is chat's, verified unclaimed
 * (`keyboard-actions.ts`). Once the details or the consent ARE open, chat's
 * keyboard is disabled for exactly that span (the same `disabled` askUser
 * uses), and the arrows, Enter, Esc -- and `v` for the consent's steps -- have
 * one owner.
 *
 * Two terminal-specific declared waivers remain: the advertiser LOGO is never
 * fetched (R-16/R-17), and a pull request URL from an older run is printed as
 * sanitized text (R-15). The advertiser's own setup link is now OPENABLE by a
 * click, through the same `safeOpen` the display ad uses -- after the same
 * destination gate (`advertiserCtaHref` is null for anything that is not
 * absolute https) -- and is printed beside the button for a terminal with no
 * mouse.
