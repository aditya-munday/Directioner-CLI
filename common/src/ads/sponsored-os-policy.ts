/**
 * Per-OS rollout switches for PAID agentic serving on Desktop.
 *
 * macOS has served paid generic offers since COD-568 with no switch of its
 * own. Every other Desktop OS reaches the same paid path only behind ONE
 * switch per OS, with exactly the same rules as macOS once it is on (Owen,
 * 2026-09-24: every agentic campaign follows the same rules on every OS, with
 * no special paths and no per-campaign lists):
 *
 * - Windows (COD-642): `DIRECTIONER_SPONSORED_WINDOWS`, surface `desktop_windows`,
 *   contained by the portable floor (`./sponsored-windows`).
 * - Linux (COD-655): `DIRECTIONER_SPONSORED_LINUX`, surface `desktop_linux`,
 *   contained by bubblewrap — a missing `bwrap` makes the client report no
 *   execution capability, so it is never offered a paid task.
 *
 * One table, one reader, one capability predicate, so every consumer (Next
 * serving, the funded Accept route, the Convex reservation and Accept
 * contracts) applies the same rule to every switched OS. Only the EXACT value
 * `on` opens a switch. Unset, `off`, `ON`, ` on `, a typo: closed. A present
 * value that is neither `on` nor `off` is reported through `onUnrecognised`
 * so an operator's typo does not look like a working switch.
