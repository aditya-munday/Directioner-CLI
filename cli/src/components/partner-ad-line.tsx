/**
 * A PARTNER placement drawn in a terminal: one row, the advertiser's colour.
 *
 * Desktop draws this deal as a pill with the advertiser's logo in it. A
 * terminal has no images, no rounded corners and no gradients, so the row is
 * the only thing left that reads as "a piece of the product wearing somebody
 * else's brand": their fill, their ink, their headline, their domain, and the
 * disclosure.
 *
 * THREE THINGS THIS FILE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, and they are all about honesty:
 *
 * - THE DISCLOSURE IS NOT CONDITIONAL. It is drawn at every width, and the
 *   layout gives up the domain before it gives up the word "Ad". A line of
 *   somebody's brand colour inside our chrome with no label on it is the one
 *   state this format may never have.
 * - THE COLOURS COME FROM THE REVIEWED CREATIVE, never from a table here. A
 *   rebrand, or a second partner, must not need a CLI release.
 * - A TERMINAL THAT CANNOT DRAW THEM DRAWS OURS. Apple Terminal has no
 *   truecolor, so a hex fill there is not "slightly off", it is wrong; the
 *   row falls back to the theme's own surface rather than lying about a
 *   brand.
