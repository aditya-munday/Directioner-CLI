/**
 * PARTNER PLACEMENTS in the CLI: one advertiser's own chrome in a terminal.
 *
 * Two slots, both `cli_chat`: a row above the input while the draft is about
 * pull requests, and a row under `/review` in the slash menu. Desktop draws
 * the same deal as a pill with the advertiser's logo in it; a terminal has no
 * images, so the row is their colour, their headline and the disclosure.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS, and nothing else does:
 *
 * - THE POLICY CHECK. A partner slot is requested only when the session's ad
 *   policy named it. While the deal is off the policy names nothing, so no
 *   request is made to be refused.
 * - THE HOLD. One answer per placement for {@link PARTNER_AD_TTL_MS}, a
 *   no-fill held exactly as firmly as a fill.
 * - ONE IMPRESSION PER HELD ANSWER. The rows mount and unmount constantly --
 *   the slash menu opens on a keystroke -- so the acknowledged set is
 *   module-level, not per component.
 *
 * It deliberately does NOT own how the row draws. `partner-ad-line.tsx` does,
 * and the advertiser console previews it from the same layout function.
