/**
 * A sponsored run's EDIT RECEIPTS, and the undo they make possible (#3989).
 *
 * An in-place run edits the user's working copy directly, so the worktree that
 * used to be the write boundary is gone (the 2026-09-24 amendment in
 * `docs/directioner-sponsored-local-execution.md`). What replaces it is a
 * RECOVERY mechanism: every file the run's own tools write is snapshotted
 * before and after, and `/ads:undo` reverse-applies those snapshots.
 *
 * The same receipts decide three things, which is the point of keeping one
 * record rather than three:
 *
 * - the VERDICT: `delivered` when at least one file changed, `failed` when none
 *   did (Desktop decides it off its turn receipts the same way);
 * - the OUTCOMES an advertiser is credited with, from the added lines;
 * - the UNDO, which restores exactly the files the verdict counted.
 *
 * ## What is and is not recorded
 *
 * Only the run's FILE TOOLS (`write_file`, `str_replace`, `apply_patch`) are
 * recorded, because only there can the before-image be captured at the moment
 * of the write. A shell command's writes are not: they happen inside the
 * sandboxed process, and a scan afterwards could only OBSERVE a change, not
 * attribute it -- the same limit Desktop's receipts have (`hasAgentEditEvidence`).
 * The undo says so when the run used the shell, rather than implying it
 * covered everything.
 *
 * A write whose before-image cannot be captured -- a file over the snapshot
 * cap, or something that is not a regular file -- is REFUSED rather than
 * performed unrecorded. An undo that silently skips the one file it could not
 * see is worse than a run told it may not touch that file.
 *
 * ## Where they live
 *
 * In the CLI's private state (`<config>/sponsored-receipts/<runId>.json`, mode
 * 0600), outside the checkout: a receipt holds file CONTENTS, and a file in
 * the project is one `git add -A` from being committed. Persisted after every
 * write, so an undo survives the CLI being closed mid-run.
