/**
 * Sacrificial watchdog process that resets the terminal if the CLI dies
 * without running its own cleanup (SIGKILL, native crash, group kill).
 *
 * The in-process handlers (renderer-cleanup.ts) cover catchable exits, and
 * the npm wrapper resets when it outlives the binary — but neither survives
 * `pkill -9 node`-style sweeps that take out the wrapper and binary together,
 * and dev/direct-binary runs have no wrapper at all. This covers those.
 *
 * POSIX:
 * - We spawn a detached `/bin/sh` whose stdin is a pipe from this process.
 *   `sh` isn't named node/bun/beyonders/directioner, so process-name kill sweeps
 *   miss it, and `detached` puts it in its own session so process-group kills
 *   miss it too.
 * - The watchdog blocks on `cat` until the pipe hits EOF — which only happens
 *   when this process is gone, however it died — then writes the reset
 *   sequences to its stdout, which is a dup of our stdout (the terminal).
 *   It must NOT open /dev/tty: being in its own session it has no controlling
 *   terminal, so that open fails with ENXIO. Writing to an inherited tty fd
 *   needs no controlling terminal.
 * - On clean shutdown the CLI first writes reset bytes synchronously to the
 *   controlling terminal, then SIGKILLs the watchdog. If that direct write
 *   fails, the watchdog remains armed and repairs the terminal after exit.
 *
 * Windows (closes the beyonders#843 after-exit gap, where the hosting
 * terminal keeps sending mouse/focus VT input that the shell echoes as
 * `^[[<35;12;7M` gibberish):
 * - Bun/libuv put direct children in a kill-on-job-close job object, so a
 *   plain child — detached or not — is terminated the moment we die
 *   (oven-sh/bun#31603) and can never fire. Grandchildren of job members are
 *   NOT added to the job (silent-breakaway semantics), so we launch a
 *   short-lived PowerShell bootstrap (in the job; its death doesn't matter)
 *   that uses Start-Process -NoNewWindow to spawn the real watchdog outside
 *   the job, attached to our console.
 * - The pipe/EOF trick can't cross the bootstrap hop, so the watchdog
 *   detects our death by waiting on our process handle instead, then writes
 *   the reset sequences to its console stdout (ConPTY forwards the disable
 *   sequences to the hosting terminal).
 * - A pid is NOT an identity on Windows. The grandchild starts hundreds of ms
 *   (on a loaded machine, tens of seconds — `arming/timeout` fired ~3.9k times
 *   in the week to 2026-09-23) after we asked for it, and a CLI can die inside
 *   that window: the npm launcher TerminateProcess'es the running binary to
 *   apply an update seconds after launch. A watchdog that then waited on "our"
 *   pid waited on whatever process Windows handed that pid to next, for as
 *   long as THAT process lived. So the bootstrap — a member of our
 *   kill-on-close job, so it only runs while we are provably alive — reads our
 *   creation time and hands it to the grandchild, which waits only on a
 *   process with that pid AND that creation time. Anything else means we are
 *   already gone.
 * - Each watchdog keeps `<disarm path>.pid` (`<its pid> <our pid>`) for
 *   exactly as long as it runs. The next launch reads those files: a watchdog
 *   still running after its owner died is reported as
 *   `cli.helper_outlived_parent`, and a machine already carrying
 *   MAX_CONCURRENT_WINDOWS_WATCHDOGS of them gets no new one — a cap on the
 *   one long-lived PowerShell this CLI owns.
 * - We hold no handle to the grandchild, so clean shutdown can't kill it.
 *   After a confirmed synchronous reset, stopTerminalWatchdog() drops a disarm
 *   file; the watchdog checks it after its wait and exits silently.
 * - Windows PowerShell 5.1 always exists and is invoked by absolute path.
 *   Scripts are passed as plain -Command text so the command lines stay
 *   human-readable in process listings (encoded PowerShell spawned by a CLI
 *   is a classic EDR/AV malware heuristic). They are deliberately built
 *   without double quotes, which makes that quoting-safe — see
 *   spawnWindowsWatchdog.
 * - Arming takes a few hundred ms (PowerShell boot); deaths inside that
 *   window fall back to the pre-existing behavior (npm wrapper or nothing).
