/**
 * Windows Desktop serving for agentic campaigns (COD-642).
 *
 * Windows has no OS sandbox under a sponsored run. Its protection is human
 * review of each campaign's procedure (against intent) plus the portable floor
 * (against accidents): scrubbed environment, redirected profile directories,
 * non-interactive git with hooks disabled, and cwd bound to the worktree.
 * `docs/directioner-sponsored-local-execution.md` records the decision (Owen,
 * 2026-09-23) and the risk it accepts.
 *
 * ONE SWITCH, NO PER-CAMPAIGN LIST (Owen, 2026-09-24). With
 * `DIRECTIONER_SPONSORED_WINDOWS=on`, EVERY agentic campaign that can serve on
 * macOS can serve on Windows, under exactly the same rules as every other
 * campaign — review, funding, servability, the classifier, the roster.
 * Campaign review already happens once per campaign; a second, Windows-only
 * list of reviewed ids was a second place to forget one. Supabase included:
 * under `DIRECTIONER_AGENTIC_ONE_FUNNEL=on` it is an ordinary generic candidate
 * and reaches Windows like everyone else.
 *
 * The switch is read here, so every consumer (Next serving, the funded Accept
 * route, the Convex reservation and Accept contracts) applies the same rule.
 * Only the EXACT value `on` opens it. Unset, `off`, `ON`, ` on `, a typo:
 * closed. A present value that is neither `on` nor `off` is reported through
 * `onUnrecognised` so an operator's typo does not look like a working switch.
