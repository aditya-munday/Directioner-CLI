 * How a sponsored file operation names a directory WITHOUT re-resolving the
 * path that led to it.
 *
 *  - `proc-fd` (Linux): the directory is held open and named
 *    `/proc/self/fd/<fd>`. The kernel resolves that magic link to the open
 *    directory itself, so `/proc/self/fd/<fd>/<name>` is `openat(fd, name)`.
 *  - `volfs` (macOS): the directory is held open and named by its identity,
 *    `/.vol/<dev>/<ino>`. The kernel looks the directory up by inode, so
 *    `/.vol/<dev>/<ino>/<name>` is `openat` on that directory. Measured on
 *    macOS 26.5 under Node 22 and Bun 1.4: `open`, `lstat`, `mkdir`, `unlink`,
 *    `rename` and `readdir` all resolve through it, and it follows the inode
 *    after the directory is renamed. A volume that does not implement it
 *    (measured: exFAT answers `ENOENT`) is REFUSED by name, never walked by
 *    pathname instead.
 *  - `lstat` (Windows): Node exposes no handle-relative open there, so each
 *    component is `lstat`ed and refused if it is a symlink or a junction, AND
 *    refused unless Windows' own final path for it (`realpathSync.native`) is
 *    the path the walk expects — `lstat` reports only some reparse points as
 *    links and silently follows the rest. Spellings Win32 would reinterpret
 *    (trailing dot or space, `:`, an 8.3 short name) are refused before any
 *    of that; see `sponsored-windows-paths.ts`. READ
 *    `docs/directioner-sponsored-local-execution.md`, "The file layer without a
 *    shell (COD-642)", before giving Windows an OS sandbox.
 *
 * Every other platform is refused: there is no mechanism, so there is no run.

/**
 * A filesystem capability rooted at one sponsored worktree, with no shell and
 * no process at all (COD-642).
 *
 * It used to run every read, listing and mutation as `/bin/sh` inside the OS
 * broker, so the kernel sandbox bounded whatever a race made the helper touch.
 * That needed a shell and a sandbox, which is why a procedure that only edited
 * files could not run on Windows. It now runs in this process, as the user,
 * and so it has to be race-free ON ITS OWN — a concurrent sandboxed command
 * (a background loop the run started) can swap any directory in the worktree
 * for a symlink at any moment, and a host-side operation that followed it
 * would be the confused deputy the sandbox exists to prevent.
 *
 * So every operation does two things:
 *
 *  1. The existing checks, unchanged: {@link containSponsoredPath} (lexical,
 *     then realpath) and the component-wise `lstat` walk that refuses any
 *     symlink. These produce the NAMED refusals a run reads.
 *  2. The operation itself, resolved by the kernel one component at a time
 *     from a held-open handle on the worktree root — each directory opened
 *     `O_NOFOLLOW` relative to the one before it, the leaf opened `O_NOFOLLOW`
 *     relative to its pinned parent. A component swapped for a symlink after
 *     step 1 is refused by the kernel (`ELOOP`), not followed. A directory
 *     moved after it was pinned can only have been moved by the sandbox, and
 *     so only to somewhere the sandbox may already write.
 *
 * Writes also refuse every class `evaluateSponsoredWritePath` refuses, asked
 * of the path as it resolves AT CHECK TIME, so a symlink inside the worktree
 * that aliases `.git` cannot carry a write the surface guard approved by
 * spelling. And a write never opens its target: the content goes to a fresh
 * file created exclusively beside it and is renamed over it through the pin,
 * so a hard-linked name is replaced rather than written through (this process
 * is not sandboxed, and the other name may be outside the worktree).
 *
 * Directory enumeration reads the pinned directory, never the pathname.
 *
 * The measurements behind this, and what it does not stop, are in
 * `docs/directioner-sponsored-local-execution.md`, "The file layer without a
 * shell (COD-642)" — private, for the reason `sponsored-sandbox.ts` gives.
